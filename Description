The visual analysis of airline performance highlights key insights into flight operations across various airports and airlines. The first visualization presents a bar chart comparing the sum of flights and the total flight length by origin airports. Major hubs such as ATL (Atlanta), ORD (Chicago), and DEN (Denver) contribute the highest flight volumes, reflecting their significance in national air traffic. These airports also show a high correlation between the number of flights and the distance traveled, indicating efficient route utilization.

The second visualization displays a segmented bar chart comparing different airlines and their performance across multiple airports. It categorizes airlines based on key metrics like flight count, flight length, and time, providing a comprehensive overview of airline activity. Notably, certain airports such as ABE and ABQ have consistent operational patterns across multiple airlines, while others show variability. 

This analysis helps identify high-traffic routes and operational bottlenecks, enabling better airline performance benchmarking. By understanding these patterns, airlines and airport authorities can optimize schedules, minimize delays, and enhance passenger experience. Overall, these visualizations offer a comprehensive overview of airline performance, supporting data-driven decision-making in the aviation industry.
